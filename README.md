# Image Zoomer

A desktop amd mobile-web compatible "image zooming" component that responds to mouse and touch events.

Demo: https://mrbinky3000.github.io/ReactImageZoomer/

Key features:
- Ultra fast animations
- ZERO component re-renders
- No memory leaks! (always a plus)
- Prevents scrolling the entire page

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It will be converted from a Single Page Application into a Library once I've gotten out of Beta development.  As of right now, I'm in Alpha, so we got some time.

## Available Scripts

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
